# Hi
We've made this little task for you, to make sure that You are able to work with basic VUE features and with JS in general. It is also important to be able to debug code, so fixing bugs shall be one of the exercises.

### Todos
 - Fix search bar - it should filter list items by their names, status and tags.
 - Fix unit test - test should check if Table.vue renders and emits events correctly.
 - Add modal item editor - allow user to edit list items with form in modal after clicking on one of the items. User should be able to save or discard changes. Allow to update name with text input and status with select input. Changes should be saved in state of ListView.vue. Use Bulma scss classes to make it simpler (it is already installed).
 - Create Your own GitHub repo and push there Your finished app
 - Bonus points for deploying app on some free hosting (e.g Firebase hosting, Netlify).
 - Even more bonus points for finding hidden message.
 
###### PS
Make sure to follow golden ratio.
